# USA_Housing_price_prediction
### Project Summary 
In this project we will be assigned with USA_Housing_csv `https://github.com/AshwinAshok3/USA_Housing_price_prediction/blob/main/USA_Housing.csv` dataset .

This is a Regression Problem most likely we will be dealing with Prediction Analysis.
where we will be dealing with all various sorts of regression algorithms and see which algorithm best suits the need for the data.

### Requirements 
* Python 3
* sklearn
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* re
* anaconda navigator
* jupyter notebook

These are all the libraries which are being used in the python project.

## Steps involved in files associations
*  (1) Read the `USA_Housing.csv` File
*  (2) Open the `USA Housing Address Parsing.ipynb` file `https://github.com/AshwinAshok3/USA_Housing_price_prediction/blob/main/USA%20Housing%20Address%20Parsing.ipynb` , here after executing all the cells we will end up with a new dataset.
*  (3) Open `USA_housing_parsed_data.csv` csv file and validate the data 'https://github.com/AshwinAshok3/USA_Housing_price_prediction/blob/main/USA_housing_parsed_data.csv'
*  (4) Now you are ready with the parsed data and henceforth we can move onto the prediction analysis phase of the project
*  (5) Open 'USA_housing_price_prediction.ipynb' file `(https://github.com/AshwinAshok3/USA_Housing_price_prediction/blob/main/USA_housing_price_prediction.ipynb)` and in the end you can find various algorithms being used and finally how many algorithms are we finally gonna consider.

# Note:
The `PDF` files and html files doesn't hold the `decision tree regressor` and `gradient boosting regressor` algorithm models hence it uses sophisticated parameters it eventually takes a huge number of hours to compute the training and testing datasets , So I have eventually completed the task and have included it in the main `ipynb` prediciton file where you would be able to observe at the end of the file and comparing the best possible models with each other.
